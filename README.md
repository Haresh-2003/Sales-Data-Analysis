## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
   cd sales-data-analysis
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the sales dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
3. View the generated reports and visualizations in the `output/` directory.

## Data Sources
The dataset should include columns such as:
- `ORDERDATE`: The date of the sale.
- `PRODUCTLINE`: Name of the product category.

- `PRICEEACH`: Unit price of the product.
- `SALES`: Total revenue from the sale.
- `CUSTOMERNAME`: Customer name.
- `TERRITORY`: Geographic region of the sale.

## Expected Outputs
- Sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Top-performing products and regions
- Customer purchase behavior insights
- Forecasted sales for upcoming periods
- Data visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts
